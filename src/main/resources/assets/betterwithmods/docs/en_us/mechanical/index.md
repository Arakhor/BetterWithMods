# Mechanical Power

Mechanical Power is a simple gear based system that can be used for many complex machines.

The first step to Mechanical Power is the [Hand Crank](../blocks/hand_crank.md) this allows for manually powering certain machines directly, such as the [Millstone](../blocks/mill.md), for early production.

The next step is to make continuous Mechanical Power through a Windmill, to do this a strong fibrous material is necessary.
[Hemp](../blocks/hemp.md) is exactly that, put this plant into the [Millstone](../blocks/mill.md) to create Hemp Fibers, to make [Rope](../items/rope.md) or [Fabric](../items/fabric.md).

Once enough Hemp Fiber is gathered, create a [Windmill](../blocks/windmill.md) to create continous Mechanical Power.
The Windmill must be placed on an [Axle](../blocks/axle.md) and need a 13x13 vertical area to be placed.

Now that you have a Windmill use Axles and Gearboxes to transfer Mechanical Power to as many machines as needed. 
Be careful though, the Windmill has one downside; When the Weather gets too rough the Windmill will rotate faster, this will eventually cause the first Gearbox connected to be overpowered and break. (Check [Gearbox](../blocks/gearbox.md) for more info)

With Continuous Mechanical Power now, more machines are available to use.

The next step to using Mechanical Power is [Tanned Leather](../items/tanned_leather.md), which is created in a [Cauldron](../blocks/cauldron.md).

A Cauldron requires a uninterrupted fire source in below it, this can be from burning netherrack or wood if you're really desperate.
Additionally, the more fire in the **3x3** around the center fire the faster the Cauldron will process.
Having a functional Cauldron opens up more possibilities, the creation of [Heating Elements](../items/element.md) and [Filaments](../items/filament.md) allow creating the [Hibachi](../blocks/hibachi.md) and [Light Blocks](../blocks/light.md) respectively,
as well as mass cooking of food and more.

With [Tanned Leather](../items/tanned_leather.md), Leather Belts can now be made to create more complex machines.

* The [Saw](../blocks/saw.md) gives access to better Log cutting as well as creating [Minimized Wood](../blocks/minimized_wood.md) for making more complex wooden items or can be used to automatically kill mobs.

* The [Filtered Hopper](../blocks/hopper.md) is a multi-purpose machine that can pick up items on top of it and be filtered with certain items to allow specified groups of items through (Find more in [Hopper Filters](../blocks/hopper.md)). It is required to create [Hellfire Dust](../items/hellfire.md) and later [Soul Urns](../blocks/soul_urn.md)


## Stoking

* The [Bellows](../blocks/bellows.md) is an air bladder that when given mechanical power will contract and blow a gust at the 3x3 in front of it, and will expand when the mechanical power is removed.
This gust of air can be used to stoke the fire's of a [Hibachi](../blocks/hibachi.md) to allowing the [Cauldron](../blocks/cauldron.md) to process Stoked Recipes as well as create a [Kiln](../blocks/kiln.md).
