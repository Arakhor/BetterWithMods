# Mechanical Power

Mechanical Power is a simple gear based system that can be used for many complex machines.

The first step to Mechanical Power is the [Hand Crank](../blocks/hand_crank.md) this allows for manually powering certain machines directly, such as the [Millstone](../blocks/single_machine.0.md), for early production.

The next step is to make continuous Mechanical Power through a Windmill, to do this a strong fibrous material is necessary.
[Hemp](../blocks/hemp.md) is exactly that, put this plant into the [Millstone](../blocks/single_machine.0.md) to create Hemp Fibers, to make [Rope](../items/rope.md) or [Fabric](../items/fabric.md).

nce enough Hemp Fiber is gathered, create a [Windmill](../blocks/windmill.md) to create continous Mechanical Power.
The Windmill must be placed on an [Axle](../blocks/axle.md) and need a 13x13 vertical area to be placed.

With this Windmill, use Axles and Gearboxes to transfer Mechanical Power to as many machines as needed. 
Be careful though, the Windmill has one downside; When the Weather gets too rough the Windmill will rotate faster, this will eventually cause the first Gearbox connected to be overpowered and break. (Check [Gearbox](../blocks/gearbox.md) for more info)
