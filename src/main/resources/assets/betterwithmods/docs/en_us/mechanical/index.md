# Mechanical Power

Mechanical Power is a simple gear based system that can be used for many complex machines.

The first step to Mechanical Power is the [Hand Crank](../blocks/hand_crank.md) this allows for manually powering certain machines directly, such as the [Millstone](../blocks/single_machine.0.md), for early production.

The next step is to make continuous Mechanical Power through a Windmill, to do this a strong fibrous material is necessary.
