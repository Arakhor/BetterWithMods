# Mechanical Power

Mechanical Power is a simple gear based system that can be used for many complex machines.

The first step to Mechanical Power is the [Hand Crank](../blocks/hand_crank.md) this allows for manually powering certain machines directly, such as the [Millstone](../blocks/single_machine.0.md), for early production.

The next step is to make continuous Mechanical Power through a Windmill, to do this a strong fibrous material is necessary.
[Hemp](../blocks/hemp.md) is exactly that, put this plant into the [Millstone](../blocks/single_machine.0.md) to create Hemp Fibers, to make [Rope](../items/rope.md) or [Fabric](../items/fabric.md).

Once enough Hemp Fiber is gathered, create a [Windmill](../blocks/windmill.md) to create continous Mechanical Power.
The Windmill must be placed on an [Axle](../blocks/axle.md) and need a 13x13 vertical area to be placed.

Now that you have a Windmill use Axles and Gearboxes to transfer Mechanical Power to as many machines as needed. 
Be careful though, the Windmill has one downside; When the Weather gets too rough the Windmill will rotate faster, this will eventually cause the first Gearbox connected to be overpowered and break. (Check [Gearbox](../blocks/gearbox.md) for more info)

With Continuous Mechanical Power now, more machines are available to use.

The [Saw](../blocks/saw.md) gives access to better Log cutting as well as creating [Minimized Wood](../blocks/minimized_wood.md) for making more complex wooden items
