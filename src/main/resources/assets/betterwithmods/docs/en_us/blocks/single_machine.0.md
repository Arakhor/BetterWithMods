# Millstone

![Millstone](block:betterwithmods:single_machine@0)

The Millstone is the machine necessary. When it receives Mechanical Power, the gear inside turns and crushes materials into a finer form.
The Items are ground up one at a time, then ejected horizontally into the world.

It can be powered by a [Hand Crank](hand_crank.md) or by an [Axle](axle.md) from the top or bottom.
